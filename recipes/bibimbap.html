        <h2>Desciption</h2>
        <p>Bibimbap, a warm Korean rice bowl topped with veggies and meat, is a filling meal that's always a good idea.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cucumbers: </strong>This bibimap recipe starts with cucumbers, cut into matchsticks, mixed with <strong>gochujang</strong> (optional, but it adds subtle heat).</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables: </strong>You’ll also need spinach, cut into thin strips, and carrots, cut into matchsticks. </li>
            <li><strong>Soy sauce: </strong>Soy sauce lends umami-rich flavor. </li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil: </strong>Cook the carrots and garlic in olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>Take the flavor up a notch with fresh garlic and dried red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Steak: </strong>This recipe calls for thinly-sliced beef — top round steak is rich and beefy, which makes it perfect for bibimbap.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>You'll need one whole egg per serving.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice: </strong>Ladle each serving over bibimbap over a cup of cooked white rice.</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame oil: </strong>Toasting the sesame oil brings out a depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame seeds: </strong>A teaspoon of sesame seeds are the perfect finishing touch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the cucumber pieces and gochujang together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cook the spinach until bright green and wilted.</li>
            <li>Drain the spinach, squeeze out as much moisture as possible, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the carrots until soft, then stir in the cucumber mixture and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Brown the beef in a different skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Fry the eggs until the yolks are runny, but whites are firm.</li>
            <li>Top each serving of rice with the spinach mixture, beef, and the cucumber mixture.</li>
            <li>Place an egg atop each serving, then drizzle with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and gochujang (if desired).</li>
